# Sentiment_Analysis_with_BERT

Sentiment Analysis with BERT

Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. The goal is to classify text data into various sentiment categories, demonstrating the power of transformer models in understanding and interpreting natural language.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is smileannotationsfinal.csv, which includes text data along with their corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as cleaning and handling class imbalances, which are crucial for the model's performance.

Model
The core of the project is the BERT model, a transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing. We fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased) to suit our sentiment classification task.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling of class imbalances, data cleaning, and preparation.
BERT Tokenization: Utilizes BERT's tokenizer for optimal text representation.
Model Training and Validation: Involves training the BERT model on the processed data and validating its performance.
Performance Metrics: Uses metrics like F1-score, accuracy, and others for evaluation.
Fine-Tuning Strategy: The model is fine-tuned for better performance specific to the sentiment analysis task.

Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. Use the following command:
pip install torch pandas tqdm transformers sklearn

Usage
Run the script to train and validate the model.
The model's performance can be evaluated using the provided metrics.

Future Improvements
Advanced Preprocessing: Explore more advanced text preprocessing techniques to improve model input quality.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Systematic hyperparameter optimization can lead to better performance.
Handling Class Imbalance: Implement more sophisticated methods to address class imbalance in the dataset.
Model Experimentation: Try other transformer models like RoBERTa or XLNet for potentially better results.
Regularization Techniques: Experiment with dropout rates and other regularization methods to reduce overfitting.
Data Augmentation: Use techniques like back-translation to augment the dataset, especially for underrepresented classes.
